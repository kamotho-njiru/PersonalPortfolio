        <h2>Why we choose Programming</h2>
        <P>
            Information technology has been a force to reckon with, it came and disrupted the status quo. It opened up alot of things and made work easier. I run an ecommerce website and now i want to revamp my website to a more complex system called blockchain
            <a href="http://www.medium.com">Visit medium.com</a> for more details. Programming is a way of bulding systems and am an inbound architect, I like the thrill and idea of building something from scratch to the final product. Programming allows
            one to be a problem solver and think outside the mental boundaries, it has the sense of uncomfortability and one is constantly faced with challenges. This aspect of completing hard tasks is rewarding and inspiration to me. that is the reason
            i choose programming.
        </P>
